        I am Fawad Imran, a fullstack developer, with expertise in Nodejs,
        Expressjs, MongoDB, Reactjs, Typescript, and Git technologies. Along
        with these I am also pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
        <br /> <br /> I have built several fullstack projects, such as an
        article sharing platform like medium.com, social media application,
        realtime chatapps, multiplayer tic-tac-toe game, a truth table generator
        and many more
        <br /> <br /> Other than fullstack, I love programming in general. I
        have also built some side projects related to C++, Java and Python
        programming languages like flappy-bird game (C++, SFML), brick-breaker
        (Java), tic-tac-toe with Minimax AI (Java), Code editor (Java), A chess
        game (Java), My own Netcut like utility tool (Python), and the list goes
        on
